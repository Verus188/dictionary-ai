  "story": "You woke up on a wooden bench in the tavern, where last night you only wanted to have a mug of ale after work. Your head was splitting, and your mouth was so dry it felt like you’d been drinking sand. A few people were still in the hall: someone was finishing their stew, someone else was playing dice.
At the next table, two men were talking, glancing at you from time to time. When you stirred, one of them smirked and said loudly enough for everyone to hear:

— Well, look who’s awake. Maybe now he’ll explain who’s paying for all this mess.

The second added, without taking his eyes off you:

— And for the broken door, too. You raised your head and looked around. The mess was real: broken mugs, an overturned table, and wood splinters on the floor, clearly from the doorframe. It all looked as though a storm had swept through the place overnight.\n\n“Wait,” you croaked, trying to get to your feet, “what mess are you talking about?”\n\nThe two men exchanged glances. The bigger one crossed his arms over his chest and said:\n\n“Don’t play dumb. Last night you came in with a group, started singing, arguing, then someone hit someone else with a mug… And it all ended with you being the first to fly through the door. Along with the door.”\n\nLaughter rippled through the hall. The dice players even stopped rolling, clearly enjoying the show.\n\nYou tried to remember—but memory hit a foggy wall. Only scraps came back: laughter, music, the smell of roasted meat… and someone’s rough shove against your shoulder.\n\n“So,” the man continued, stepping closer, “either you pay, or the innkeeper will hand you over to the city guard.”",
